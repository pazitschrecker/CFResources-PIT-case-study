          <p>
            This was the capstone project for our COMSE6998 Public Interest
            Technology class. We aimed to create a web application that would
            allow community fridge volunteers and organizers to share
            information and resources with one another in a centralized and user
            friendly way. Our product is an example of public interest
            technology because it aims to assist mutual aid organizers who
            promote social good in their communities.

          <h2>The Problem Space</h2>

          <p>
            Community fridges are mutual aid projects in which community members
            stock and maintain publicly accessible fridges to provide food to
            whoever needs it. The first fridge in NYC was set up in February of
            2020 and since then the movement has grown to over 70 fridges. Since
            this is a new and growing movement, organizers are constantly in the
            process of figuring out what works and what does not. Due to the
            autonomous and decentralized structure of community fridge networks,
            each fridge has its own set of practices and resources. While
            organizers often collaborate and learn from one another, there is no
            openly accessible platform for resource sharing across all fridges
            in a given area.

          Guiding PIT Question: Is focusing on organizers and volunteers the
          right approach? If not, what perspectives are missing from our
          research?
        </p>
        <h2>Background Research</h2>

        <p>
          Our research began with food insecurity, when a household has limited
          or uncertain access to food. We focused our background research on
          news articles and reports from NYC based organizations, all of which
          were citing similar data that revealed food insecurity has
          dramatically increased due to the pandemic. During the pandemic in
          NYC, there has also been an amazing increase in mutual aid, or
          community members helping and supporting one another without stigma
          associated with charity. A mutual aid project to combat food
          insecurity that grew in popularity during the pandemic are community
          fridges, refrigerators located in a public space that provide fresh
          free food to community members. The fridge is restocked by community
          members (also known as community fridge organizers) and is open to
          everyone, functioning in a policy of “Take what you need, leave what
          you can.”
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          After identifying community fridges in NYC as an area of interest,
          we looked at articles to learn the details of how community fridges
          operate and if technology could support them. Many of the articles
          we found were features of community fridge organizers posted this
          summer when the movement first began receiving attention from
          websites like the New York Times.

          <h2>Engagement</h2>

          <p>
            Since community fridges are a relatively new movement, there is a
            sparse amount of information available about them online and once we
            had gone through it all, we turned to Instagram to get in contact
            with fridge organizers. Instagram is the primary platform where
            community fridge organizers will post information and updates about
            their respective fridges. We began by documenting all the community
            fridge instagram accounts we came across and DM’ing them to request
            interviews to learn more about their work.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Through interviews, we quickly learned that community fridges are
            autonomous and decentralized, so each fridge operates and organizes
            itself differently. Despite differences in how fridges operate,
            there are common tasks that each fridge undertakes in order to
            provide food to community members and we designed a diagram of the
            Community Fridge Process to visualize these core commonalities.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In addition, we created four Personas and User Journey Maps in order
            to capture high and low points organizers expressed in interviews.

            Is our design familiar, accessible, and conducive to
            knowledge-sharing?
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The direction our project took was limited to who we were able to
            interview. All of the information we gathered and interviews we
            conducted focused on community fridge organizers and their
            experience with maintaining a community fridge. We were not able to
            identify and interview other stakeholders of a community fridge,
            such as food insecure populations and/or people who utilize
            community fridges. While organizers are easily contactable online
            via instagram, there is no way to know who is using fridges. Since
            that is a perspective we were missing, it heavily influenced the
            direction we continued in.

          <p>
            After interviewing ten community fridge organizers and creating four
            user journey maps, we came up with a list of 14 themes that captured
            common pain points in the community fridge process. In order to
            narrow these themes to the most relevant few, we designed an
            affinity map that grouped insightful quotes from all ten interviews
            based on the theme they expressed. With the help of the affinity
            map, we were able to identify eight themes that had been brought up
            the most in interviews and from there we ideated on one way we could
            potentially target or address this theme. We also looked at previous
            solutions to these themes and identified the pros and cons of each.
            Once we had a more comprehensive picture of the needs and obstacles
            of community organizers, as well as potential solutions, we
            developed three How Might We statements that captured overarching
            themes we felt we could meaningfully address this semester. For each
            How Might We, we brainstormed 30 ideas and used a mindmap to
            visualize where they branch off from one another. We then narrowed
            them down to five coherent and varied ideas per How Might We and
            identified the risks of each.

            Guiding PIT Question: Is our design familiar, accessible, and
            conducive to knowledge-sharing?
          </p>
          <h2>Research impact</h2>

          <p>
            Based on the main pain points expressed to us by community fridge
            organizers, we narrowed down our potential product to four ideas: a
            scheduling app, a physical sensor to track fridge emptiness, a
            collaboration with an existing application, and a living resource
            document. We created low-fidelity wireframes for each of these
            designs. The scheduling app would have created a single location for
            volunteers and organizers to coordinate restocking shifts with one
            another; the sensors would have been physically attached to each
            fridge to track how long the fridge was opened for, in order to
            judge emptiness intervals; the collaboration with an existing
            application would have focused on connecting local businesses with
            community fridges; and the living resource document would allow
            community fridges to share various resources, templates, and
            information with one another to help the community fridge network
            flourish.
            <br />
            Eventually, we settled on moving forward with the resource document,
            based on subsequent user tests in which we asked our target users
            about how effective and how helpful they anticipated each design
            being for them. While our interviewees were split on the resource
            document versus an app, we realized that a place for community
            fridges to share resources with one another upheld the core tenets
            of the mutual aid structure, despite being somewhat less flashy than
            an app. It had also become clear that organizers would be hesitant
            to download another app, since the organization process is already
            spread out across several platforms. Once we settled on a single
            design, we decided based on user interviews that email templates,
            resource guides, and a community forum would be the most useful
            sections to include.

          <h2>Visual Language and Design</h2>

          <p>
            Our prototype utilizes a blue and green color palette, as well as a
            rounded, cartoonish theme throughout. Originally, we considered
            using a more minimalist, “cleaner” design, but decided that the
            colors and fun icons were more appealing based on initial user
            tests. In terms of the layout, we looked to familiar websites that
            served similar purposes to our own for inspiration, such as
            Dribbble, Ladder, and others.

          <p>
            The Double diamond design process created a structure that allowed
            us to anticipate what was coming next, yet at the same time we found
            it to be difficult to not move ahead. When the team was trying to
            conduct interviews to identify problems, we were also thinking ahead
            and asking about solutions when we should not have remained focused
            on the define stage. We had to step back and remain within the
            structure. We needed to remember to not jump ahead before we fully
            explore the problem.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            This brings us to our group’s key takeaway from the PIT design
            process.Throughout this process, we learned that there are different
            priorities within the target users and that they have different
            needs and wants and our prototype was not going to be able to
            accommodate everyone’s needs equally.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            As we went through the design process, there were different user
            groups that were drawn to different solutions, and we realized that
            we wouldn’t be able to solve every need that we found. Instead, we
            had to decide which subset of the user group we wanted to have an
            impact on in order to focus our solution on their needs. More
            specifically, in our case, when we discovered there was a divide in
            what the white, male organizers’ needs vs. younger, biopic female
            organizers, we decided to focus on the latter to meet the needs of a
            group whose voices aren’t heard as loudly. As such, we decided to
            focus on the living resource guide over the scheduling app, although
            we knew there would be tradeoffs in whose needs would be met. Rather
            than solving for everyone’s needs and broadening the scope of our
            solution too large, we focused on a subset of our user group in
            order to more effectively meet their needs.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Taking a public interest approach to our design allowed for us to
            engage with the target audience earlier then we may have. This
            allowed us to have a more impactful design process and ultimately a
            better understanding of the problem and the community fridge
            network. This process can be frustrating, and it may appear lineral
            but stepping back and forth between phases helps work through
            confusion and can lead to more defined solutions.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            While there were other “fancier” solutions we considered that
            could’ve been more interesting to look at, we ultimately decided to
            focus on a simpler, living resource guide that met the needs of our
            user. Furthermore, we wanted to consistently keep in mind what
            technology our users had access to, since public interest technology
            should first and foremost be accessible to our users.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Our ultimate goal of public interest technology was to help the
            community, so we wanted to always make sure our interests were
            aligned with their needs. One of the most important elements of our
            design process was consistently empathizing with our users by going
            back to them at every step. For example, one thing we always kept in
            mind was keeping the mutual-aid framework of community fridges and
            respecting their desires to keep the decentralized system. Rather
            than asserting our own opinions, we made sure our goals were aligned
            with our communitys'.
